    "# Operation of Running Systems\n",
    "- Boot Process\n",
    "  - The Boot Process on an x86 system can be categorized into 4 sequential phases:\n",
    "    - The Firmware phase\n",
    "      - BIOS runs the POST\n",
    "      - Video drivers are installed\n",
    "      - The BIOS scans for a storage device containing a boot loader. This device will contain a master boot record. \n",
    "        A Master Boot Record contains a 512 byte image containing 446 bytes of the bootloader program, 64 bytes for the \n",
    "        partition table, and the last 2 bytes for the boot signature. \n",
    "      - The MBR is located on the first sector of the boot disk.\n",
    "    - The Bootloader Phase\n",
    "      - GRUB2 is a common boot loader used in Linux\n",
    "      - The primary job of the boot loader is to locate the linux kernel (in /boot), decompress it, load it into memory based\n",
    "        on the configuration in `/etc/grub2/grub.cfg`, and pass control to it. \n",
    "      - For EFI Systems, grub2 loads the kernel based on the `/boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.efi` file\n",
    "      - The `grub.cfg` and `grub.efi` files are generated automatically based on the `/etc/default/grub2` file. These files are regenerated\n",
    "        automatically when a new kernel is installed, so you should not modify them directly. Instead, make any changes to `/etc/default/grub2`\n",
    "      - After modifying `/etc/default/grub2`, you'll need to run `grub2-mkconfig` to regenerate the files in `/boot`\n",
    "      - `grub2-mkconfig` uses scripts in `/etc/grub.d/` to help regenerate the grub2.cfg file\n",
    "    - The Kernel Phase\n",
    "      - After getting control from the bootloader, the kernel extracts the initial ramdisk (`/boot/initramfs`) file system image, decompresses\n",
    "        it, and mounts it as read-only at `/sysroot`, from there it loads drivers and then mounts the root file system on `/` as read/write.\n",
    "      - The kernel then executes the init daemon (systemd) with PID 1 and passes control to it\n",
    "      - The kernel and its support files are spread across the system. Typically in `/boot`, `/proc`, and `/usr/lib/modules`\n",
    "      - Always install new versions of the kernel instead of upgrading. The upgrade process removes the old kernel. In case of a problem,\n",
    "        you will not be able to revert the upgrade.\n",
    "    - The Init Phase\n",
    "      - systemd starts all userspace system and network services and brings the system up to the preset boot target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reboot/Shutdown\n",
    "  - You can use `sudo systemctl reboot --force` to force a system to reboot\n",
    "  - only the superuser can reboot \n",
    "  - `shutdown` takes a time parameter for scheduling a shutdown. \n",
    "    - ex: `shutdown 03:00` = shutdown at 3AM\n",
    "    - `shutdown +15` shutdown in 15 minutes\n",
    "- Operating Modes\n",
    "  - `systemctl get-default` will show you the default target\n",
    "  - Examples of operating modes:\n",
    "    - graphical\n",
    "    - multi-user\n",
    "    - single-user\n",
    "  - use `systemctl set-default multi-user.target` to set the default operating mode, then reboot\n",
    "  - You can switch to a target without booting by typing `systemctl isolate graphical.target`, but this does not change the default boot target\n",
    "  - Useful targets:\n",
    "    - emergency.target = root file system is read-only. Minimal amount of programs loaded\n",
    "    - rescue.target = a few services are loaded and you are dropped into a root shell\n",
    "      - You must have a password set for the root user to use either of these operating modes\n",
    "- Boot Loaders\n",
    "  - The boot loader starts the linux kernel\n",
    "  - GRUB is a popular boot loader for Linux\n",
    "  - To generate a grub configuration file:\n",
    "    - grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg for BIOS systems\n",
    "    - grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/grub.cfg for EFI systems\n",
    "    - grub2-install can be used to install grub on a disk\n",
    "    - The boot loader is typically stored on the first few sectors of a disk \n",
    "    - The grub2.cfg file is typically stored at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg for BIOS systems\n",
    "  - /etc/default/grub is used by the grub2-mkconfig utility to determine what settings to use when it generates the grub2.cfg file. After you modify this file, you need to run `grub2-mkconfig` to actually regenerate the grub2 config\n",
    "      ~~~shell\n",
    "      GRUB_TIMEOUT=1\n",
    "      GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown\n",

    "  - Install, Configure, and Troubleshoot BootLoaders\n",
    "    - To regenerate grub2 config:\n",
    "      - Boot into recovery media, then:\n",
    "        - `chroot /mnt/sysroot`\n",
    "        - To regenerate grub config for BIOS system\n",
    "          - `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`\n",

    "    - To reinstall the boot loader:\n",
    "      - BIOS systems:\n",
    "        -  Use `lsblk` to look at block devices. Try to identify the boot device\n",
    "        -  Use `grub2-install /dev/sda` to install grub to the boot device\n",
    "     -  EFI Systems:\n",
    "        -  Use `dnf reinstall grub2-efi grub2-efi-modules shim` to reinstall grub to the boot device\n",

    "- Scripting\n",
    "  - type `help` to get a list of bash-builtins\n",
    "  - Some examples of bash built-ins:\n",
    "    - `cd`, `pwd`, `source`, `exec`, `break`, `umask`, etc\n",
    "    - Bash built-ins do not launch a new process\n",
    "    - Commands in directories such as `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin` are external to the shell, and the\n",
    "    shell launches a new sub-shell process for them\n",
    "  - There are 2 types of unit configuration files:\n",
    "    - system unit files are preinstalled with the operating system and are located at `/usr/lib/systemd/system`\n",
    "    - User init files that are user defined and are located at `/etc/systemd/user`\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "- Manage startup processes and services\n",
    "  - Systemd\n",
    "    - The init system is responsible for starting the system and all unit files \n",
    "      - Units are systemd objecfts used for organizing boot and maintenance tasks. Units consist of mounts, services, sockets, devices, and timers, etc.\n",
    "      There are 11 unit types\n",
    "      - Services units tells the init system what it needs to know about the life cycle of an application\n",
    "      - systemd is the init system typically\n",
    "      - Use `systemctl cat sshd.service` to view the unit file for a service\n",
    "      - Use `systemctl edit --full sshd.service` to edit a unit file\n",
    "      - use `systemctl revert sshd.service` to revert the unit file to the default\n",
    "    - To prevent a service from being started, you can mask it\n",
    "      - systemctl mask sshd.service\n",
    "    - Targets are simply logical collections of units. \n",
    "      - Target files end in the `.target` extension.\n",
    "      - Systemd includes several predefined targets:\n",
    "        - halt: shuts down and halts the system\n",
    "        - poweroff: shuts down and powers off the system\n",
    "        - shutdown: shuts down the system\n",
    "        - rescue: boots into single user mode for recovery. All local file systems are mounted. Networking is disabled. Some essential services are started\n",
    "        - emergency: Runs an emergency shell. The root file system is mounted in read-only mode, other file systems are not mounted. Network and other services are disabled\n",
    "        - multi-user: full network support, but without a GUI\n",
    "        - graphical: full network support with a GUI\n",
    "        - reboot: shuts down and reboots the system\n",
    "        - default: a special soft link that points to the default system boot target (multi-user or graphical)\n",
    "        - hibernate: Puts the system into hibernation \n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing and Diagnosing Processes\n",
    "  - At any time, a process can be in 1 of 5 states\n",
    "    - Running: the process is being executed by the system\n",
    "    - sleeping: the process is waiting for input from another process or user\n",
    "    - waiting: the process has received any input is was waiting on and is now waiting to be scheduled on a CPU\n",
    "    - stopped: The process is currently stopped and not running\n",
    "    - zombie: the process is dead. The process still exists in the process table, but it takes up no system resources. \n",
