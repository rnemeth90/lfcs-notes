    "- Inodes\n",
    "  - An inode is a reference to a file on the disk\n",
    "  - The `stat` command can be used to view inodes\n",

    "- `readlink` can be used to view the file behind a softlink\n",
    "- broken soft links are highlighted in red in the output of `ls -l`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File System Permissions\n",

    "  - b: block device\n",
    "- Linux assigns default permissions to a file or directory when it is created. \n",
    "  - Default permissions are calculated based on the umask permission value subtracted from a preset initial permission value\n",
    "    - The umask is a 3 digit octal value that refers to read, write, and execute permissions\n",
    "    - The default umask for the root user is 0022\n",
    "    - The default umask for standard users is 0002\n",
    "    - To view the current umask, run the `umask` command without any options\n",
    "    - The predefined initial permissions values are 666 for files and 777 for directories\n",
    "    - If you modify the umask, it will be set backt to 0022/0002 when you logoff. You need to add it to the appropriate shell startup\n",
    "      file. `~/.bash_rc` or `~/.bash_profile`\n",

    "- `chmod` can be used to change permissions on a file or directory\n",
    "- SUID, GID, Sticky Bit Permissions\n",
    "  - SUID = Set UserId bit\n",
    "  - When the SUID bit is set, the file is executed as the owner of the file, rather than the person running that file\n",

    "    [azureadmin@centos01 ~]$ touch suidfile\n",
    "    [azureadmin@centos01 ~]$ ls suidfile\n",
    "    suidfile\n",

    "    -rw-rw-r--. 1 azureadmin azureadmin 0 Aug 28 17:46 suidfile\n",
    "    [azureadmin@centos01 ~]$ chmod 4660 suidfile\n",

    "  - Find GUID Files: `find . -perm /2000`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Sticky Bit\n",
    "    - The sticky bit is typically set on public directories to inhibit file erasures by non-owners\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ACLs\n",
    "    - In addition to the standard UGO/RWX permission model, you can also apply ACLs to files and directories\n",
    "    - ACLs define permissions for named users and named groups\n",
    "    - ACLs are categorized into two groups, default ACLs and access ACLs\n",
    "      - Access ACLs are set on individual files and directories\n",
    "      - Default ACLs can only be applied at the directory level and are inherited by subdirectories and files\n",

    "      - `getfacl` and `setfacl`\n",
    "      - \n",
    "\n",
    "### Manipulating File Content\n",
    "- use cat to read a file to stdout\n",
    "- use tac to read a file in reverse to stdout\n",
    "- use sed to search and replace text in a file\n",
    "  - Example: `sed 's/canda/canada/g' userinfo.txt`\n",
    "  - without the 'g', sed only replaces the first occurence of the word in each line\n",
    "  - use `-i` to replace in-line\n",
    "- Use cut to extract content from a file\n",
    "  - Example: `cut -d ' ' -f 1 userinfo.txt`\n",
    "- `uniq` can be used to get unique entries in a file, but the entries must be sorted first\n",
    "  - Example: `sort countries.txt | uniq`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Archive and Backup Data\n",
    "- Use `tar -tf myFile.tar` to view the contents of a tarball\n",
    "- Use `tar cvf myFile.tar mydir` to archive a directory\n",
    "- use `tar xvf myFile.tar` to extract the contents of a tarball\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compress and Decompress Files\n",
    "- gzip, bzip2, and xz can be used to compress/decompress files\n",
    "- These compression utilities only compress a single file, which is why they are often combined with `tar`\n",
    "  - `tar czf archive.tar.gz myFile` = Create gzip compressed tarball\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backup files to a remote system\n",
    "- use `rsync` to copy files to/from a remote system\n",
    "- `dd` can be used to create an image of a disk\n",
    "  - unmount the disk first\n",
    "  - `sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=diskImage.raw bs=1M status=progress`\n",
    "  - reverse `if` and `of` to restore an image\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input/Output Redirection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search for files and directories\n",
    "- the `find` command is a powerful tool that can be used to search for files and directories \n",
    "- the `locate` command is used to locate occurrences of a specified string as they appear in path names\n",
    "  - `locate` searches `/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db` every time you run it, rather than searching the directory directly\n",
    "  - the `mlocate.db` directory can be created or updated using the `updatedb` command\n",
